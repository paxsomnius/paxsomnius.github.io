# The suspension of Roe v Wade 

My initial though was WTF, this has to be an Onion article I had missed the memo leak of the impending doom of RVW, because I have been working full time lately at the day job and part-time on Algoneer, and I like to practice military disapline when completeing an important goal, like breaking into the web/software development industry.

So I was happily oblivious to the goings on at the USSP kremlin, until recently when the roars of dissent reached even me while inside of my work-home-work-sleep-repeat (WHWSR) bubble, and again WTF IS GOING ON man HAS NOBODY READ 

## FREAKONOMICS!?!?!
